This project is based off: https://www.instructables.com/id/IoT-Split-flap-Weather-Forecast-Powered-by-XOD/

This application fetches information such as the weather or social media followers and displays it on a "split-flap" board made of laser cut acrylic, some DC motors, sensors, and a RaspberryPi all in NodeJS.
